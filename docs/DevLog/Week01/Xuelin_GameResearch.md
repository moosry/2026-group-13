# Hollow Knight

## (1) Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Combat
- Basic attack: use a simple melee weapon (can attack in multiple directions)
- Skills: use “Soul” to cast spells  
- Soul can be gained by hitting enemies
- Soul can be spent on offensive abilities or on healing
- Players must balance offense and defense during combat

### Gameplay Loop
Explore → Fight → Die or Succeed → Learn → Explore Further

### Exploration
- Large interconnected map
- New areas unlock gradually as the game progresses

### Death System
- Upon death, the player drops their in‑game currency and generates a “shade”
- Defeating the shade allows recovery of lost resources

### Non‑Linear Progression
- Players can tackle areas and bosses in multiple possible orders

## (2) Design Inspiration
- Focus on simple core mechanics
- Use shared resources to create meaningful player decisions
- Non‑linear map structure enhances replayability
